About "WebSite" folder.

May 25, 2011

This is the INTER-Mediator web site materials.
You could see the site "inter-mediator.org" is driven by INTER-Mediator.
I will update the site day by day, so this folder might not be complete same as site.
Although you could see here as the sample of how to build the "Read-Only" site.

If you want to try them. Please make sure below:

- You should specify the valid path to INTER-Mediator folder on website_include.php and DB_WebSite_FMSFX.php file.
- FileMaker Database "WebSite.fp7" should be published by the FileMaker Server.
- FileMaker DB's "Admin" password is just "password".
- I'm not intend to build with MySQL so far, because it requires to make any contents management features.
