Ver.0.5 (2010/1/xx)  ==Next Release Candidate==
- Release with version number. I think current one is more than 0.1 but less than 1.0. So the number is going to start from 0.5.
- Open the GitHub repository.
- Add the license notice to all sources.

- Logo is created.

2010/1/16
- MySQL Support.
- XSS Security problem was fixed (Thanks to Mr.Atsushi Matsuo).
- Bug fix of Data Converter Class processing.
- Changed the parameter of InitializePage function, 'skip' -> 'records' in first parameter's first parameter.
- Changed the parameter of InitializePage function, 'repeat-control' -> 'repeat-control' in each element of first parameter. The value of this key should contain strings 'delete' and/or 'insert'.
- Bug fix: Inserting and deleting a record of repeat table wasn't cause of the alert when move to other record or page without saving.
- Bug fix: Tried to save in spite of no editable fields for a record.
- Rearranged sample files. To access samples just open the file 'index.html'.
- IE8 will work fine, I strongly hope so. I started to check IE8 too.

2010/1/12
- When you clicked "Save", you saw the dialog box showing the posing data. This is just a signature of my debugging and it's not a feature. This is maintenance release to avoid the futile dialog box.
